# 2bit PXLR Studio
**2bit PXLR Studio** is a custom ROM for the Gameboy Camera targeted on accessing the full potential of the original Game Boy Camera's sensor, as well as giving photographers more control.   
It is meant to be used with [HDR's flashable Game Boy Camera PCB](https://github.com/HDR/Gameboy-Camera-Flashcart).   
You can tag your images with [#2bitpxlr](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/2bitpxlr/).   

## Current features:
+ Most settings of the camera's sensor are already configurable:
  + Sensor gain
  + Exposure time
  + Dithering matrices
  + All edge enhancement settings
  + Output node bias voltage
  + Zero point calibration
  + Output reference voltage offset
+ Raw image data can be saved to the same positions where the original ROM stores it's data.
+ Sensor settings are being saved across restarts. To reset hold `start`+`select` on boot

## Missing features:
- Displaying images
- Sorting/deleting images
- Thumbnail generation
- Setting new saved images to visible
- Better UI in general
- Saving "EXIF-like" information with an image (possibly in the comment area for an image)
- Different modes for taking images:
  - Automatic exposure
  - Presets for separate light-levels (daylight, inside, night, etc...)
  - Re-using settings (from "EXIF-like" info)
  - suggestions welcome
- Printing images
- Storing settings persistently in the RAM (using momory-areas which do not get deleted by a reset of a parallel original ROM)
- Using beep-tones to transfer an image without any additional hardware. [Decoder by RaphaÃ«l Boichot](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/custom-camera-rom-beep-tone-converter)
- Panorama helper (allowing more than the original four images)

# Feedback
**Remember: I can only improve things I know about!!**  
If you have actually used this ROM any type of feedback is very much appreciated. This includes but is not restricted to things like:
+ "I'd like to have feature XX"
+ "I've used the following combination of parameters which work really well/bad"
+ "When I set param XX, I'd also like param YY to change"

# Building
This project has been created with [GBDK 2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020).  
This project requires an environment variable `GBDK_FOLDER="..."` pointing to the `bin` folder of GBDK  
E.g. on wsl for windows add `export GBDK_FOLDER="/mnt/c/path_to_gbdk/bin"` to your `.bashrc`
